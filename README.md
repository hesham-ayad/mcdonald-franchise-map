# [A Web Mapping course project](<https://www.udemy.com/course/intro-to-web-programming-for-gis-and-mapping>)

The project is basically a map that shows the number of McDonald's in each state in the USA in a way that's easy for the user to see.

The map is made with:

- [**MapLibre**](<https://maplibre.org>) an open-source mapping.
- **Tiles** are sourced from [Open Street Map](<http://www.openstreetmap.org>).
